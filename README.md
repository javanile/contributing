# 💫 Contributing to Javanile

![Welcome!](.github/assets/welcome.gif)

## 🧐 Read me first! ⬇️⬇️⬇️ 

In Javanile, we are few people, but with many ideas all based on Open Source, we are highly grateful, even for your small contribution. Even a single line of code written by you makes our projects better. If you have free time and want to test yourself, perhaps learning successful technologies such as NodeJS, PHP, Docker, BASH and much more, we are also ready to help you to improve your skills for free as a way to thank you for your contributions in our projects.

## 🏁 Start with contribution

To leave your Open Source contribution, you have to choose among the issues we have collected and organized. In this way, you can find the one that best fits your availability or skills.
